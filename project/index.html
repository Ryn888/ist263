                <p>
                    Hello! My name is Lauryn Rivers and I am 22 years old. I was born and raised in Boston, Massachusetts but currently resided in Syracuse, New York.

                <h2>My Story:</h2>
                <p>
                    I got my love for traveling from my mom. Ever since I was a toddler, my mom would plan out and pack us up for road trips every summer. Whether it be to the next state over or going down the coast, my mom made sure our car was always full of gas and snacks were kept in the back seat. Years later, I got to travel farther and farther and eventually got to see cities outside of the U.S. (something I did not imagine I could do when I was younger). With my passport in hand, I am eager to explore the world again (once the pandemic is over). Until then, I will reminisce through this travel diary.

                <p>
                    This website is designed to act as a recording of the different cities and countries I have been to. I hope to encourage other people to explore new places through recording my experiences.
