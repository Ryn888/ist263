                <h2>How Did I Get Here?</h2>
                <p>
                    In the 10th grade, my school offered to lead a trip to Spain in order to visit the sister school there. It was my first trip out of the country without my mom coming with me.

                        <h3>Plaza De Espana</h3>

                        <p>
                            As the name suggests, the Plaza De Espana is a large plaza. I was able to walk around here on a bright sunny day, so I was able to take in all the beauty of the architecture. Water is also a big feature of the plaza with a canal running by and a large fountain in the center. There were a few street merchants on the plaza, so be sure to bring some cash for a cool souvenir.

                        <h3>Alcazar of Seville</h3>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="media/Alcazar_of_seville_long_v3.jpg" alt="A large plaza with a fountain on one side and a building on the other">
                        </figure>
                        <p>
                            This palace has both beautiful tile decorated rooms and large bright green gardens. The building was quite full of other tourists however, it is well worth the crowds. I enjoyed taking photos of the scene so I would make sure my phone was fully charged before heading hear again

                <h3>Favorite Food - Churros</h3>
                    <p>
                        I ate these every single morning. Similar to fried dough, this delicacy is pretty common and is usually eaten with chocolate sauce.
