            <p>
            My name is Lauryn Rivers. I am a computer science major interested in software 
            development and testing. I also enjoy data analysis. I participated in last years 
            ‘cuse hackathon and my team received recognition for best inclusion and diversity hack 
            for our app prototype.

            <h2 class="special">Personal Info</h2>
            <p>
            For hobbies, I enjoy playing games on my Nintendo switch and I read webcomics. 
            I like canoeing but only in the summer. Currently I’m binge watching Bob’s Burgers. 
            I was born and raised in Boston, MA but I enjoy traveling. I tend to do road trips 
            with my mom. Outside of the US, my favorite place so far was <strong>Seville, Spain </strong>but 
            I have also been to Copenhagen, Amsterdam, the Bahamas, and a couple of cities 
            in Ireland. I hope to travel more when Covid dies down.
            </p>
