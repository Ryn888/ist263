        <h1>Lauryn's Biography</h1>

        <p>
        My name is Lauryn Rivers. I am a computer science major interested in software 
        development and testing. I also enjoy data analysis. I participated in last years 
        ‘cuse hackathon and my team received recognition for best inclusion and diversity hack 
        for our app prototype.

        <h2>Personal Info</h2>
        <p>
        For hobbies, I enjoy playing games on my Nintendo switch and I read webcomics. 
        I like canoeing but only in the summer. Currently I’m binge watching Bob’s Burgers. 
        I was born and raised in Boston, MA but I enjoy traveling. I tend to do road trips 
        with my mom. Outside of the US, my favorite place so far was <strong>Seville, Spain </strong>but 
        I have also been to Copenhagen, Amsterdam, the Bahamas, and a couple of cities 
        in Ireland. I hope to travel more when Covid dies down.
        </p>
