        My name is Lauryn Rivers. I am a computer science major interested in software development and testing. I also enjoy data analysis. I participated in last years ‘cuse hackathon and my team received recognition for best inclusion and diversity hack for an app prototype. For hobbies, I enjoy playing games on my Nintendo switch and I read webcomics. I like canoeing but only in the summer. Currently I’m binge watching Bob’s Burgers. I was born and raised in Boston, MA but I enjoy traveling. I tend to do road trips with my mom. Outside of the US, my favorite place so far was Seville, Spain but I have also been to Copenhagen, Amsterdam, the Bahamas, and a couple of cities in Ireland. I hope to travel more when Covid dies down.
